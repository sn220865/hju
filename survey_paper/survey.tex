\section{Introduction}
 In 2010, Eckerlsey \cite{eckersley2010unique} introduced browser fingerprinting which is stateless tracking technique. When users visit some browser, their device provides the information of the site they visited including a set of browser and system attributes such as operating system, settings, and the hardware details. The combination of this information is called browser fingerprinting, and it can be used to identify and track users. In 2018, Vastel \cite{vastel2018fp} introduced 4 distinct levels in which fingerprint inconsistencies are detected; OS-level, browser-level, device-level, and canvas-level. From this paper, we found that we can obtain the features of browser fingerprints from those four different levels. Based on this idea, we will implement various fingerprinters by using attributes divided into 4 distinct levels, and evaluate which level and which attributes are more efficient to identify users. In addition to evaluate general attributes of browser fingerprints, we also implement several fingerprinting technologies only for mobile devices recently discovered\cite{laperdrix2016beauty}.

\section{Advanced Techniques}

\subsection{Uniqueness}
In these days, mobile devices are becoming the main platform for browsing the web. Thus, many studies\cite{lim2016characterizing, miskovic2015appprint, bermejo2017steal, van2016accelerometer} which found new fingerprints from a mobile device with not only general fingerprinting attributes but also other factors to identify the user have emerged. In this section, we will introduce several fingerprinting attributes.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper will indicate that which level and which attributes are the most efficient one that can identify user well. Also, we will focus on the mobile fingerprinting with diverse factors. Hence, we can indicate that which factor of the mobile fingerprinting attributes considering the-state-of-the-art technologies is the most efficient one on the mobile device. From this paper, we can evaluate the-state-of-the-art techniques compared to previous evaluated technologies.
